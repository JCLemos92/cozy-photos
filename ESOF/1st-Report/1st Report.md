# Development Process

## Development Process Description

As stated in the Assignment we needed to know more about the development process of the Project. 
Given that, we created a new Forum Thread where we asked the developers for informaton regarding this matter.
In a matter of a day they successfully answered.

Link to the Thread Page with the response: https://forum.cozy.io/t/development-process/3539

The first fact stated was about the multiple development processes.
As the project was in development multiple differente aproaches were implemented.
It was almost impossible to stick to one simple development process to the end. So the team had to further discuss new methods of development. For example, the week were we contacted the developers they were about to implement a new run!

It is also stated that there is a very good consistency regarding the first ideas and the managment process. The results are very straightforward with the initial concepts.

As it was to expect from this kind of plan, the team has two big project supervisors (Two Bosses) and around 25 people distributed by self-organized teams, that collaborate together. Of course something like this is very important to keep consistency in the company.

We also asked for a little bit of history around the team to better understand the organization implied.

The project started around 4 to 5 years ago where both future co-founders had the idea of
> a more open and decentralized web, a web where privacy can be used to leverage a huge value for the users through new services and features

Both founders founded the company by the end of 2012 and started recruiting interns. Some stopped being just interns and are still in the company with a well deserved job. It all expanded from there. The company was able to raise money and started recruiting more people which lead to the team that is around the project nowadays.

## Opinions, Critics and Alternatives

### Impressions and Description of Cozy Photos Platform
Cozy Photos is a small cloud platform to create albums of photos that you can share between friends.
The Inferface is very User-Frinedly and not to Graphical heavy, which helps to have a more intuitive interaction with new Users.
It is structered in Albums and it is possible to "Drag N' Drop" photos on any album or manually upload. 
Each Album includes a title and a small description of the content and it is possible to edit this values any time.
The Share option is still Primitive for it is only possible to share through email.

The developers did not advanced much more information regarding the development processes. So the team decided to simulate what would it be like if the Project had been supervised under different Processes.
It is important to know:
- Team with 25+ elements
- Distributted into other small groups

### Common Process
The common Process is designed in 4 different parts.
- Software Specification
- Software Design and Implementation
- Software Validation
- Software Evolution

The first part is when everyone gathers together to find what they really need and what will they implement. In a more common case it this step would have been made with the client. However the developers are their own clients, along with the rest of the world. So there is a more free willing end. 
Once the goal is set. Small teams are going to be created and designated to different tasks. This provides a more efficient development process rather than the hole team concetrated with a task at a time. After a long time it is time for Step 3. Consisting in fixing numerous issues and validate the final product to know if it correspondes to the first concepts and ideas.
If there is a mutual consensus wheter the project can finally be launched in the market. It goes directily into step 4. Launching the product and start a strict and constant supervision and evolution.

Pros:
- Too much time consuming and unpredicted aditional costs if something is out of the project intial concept in the final steps. 
- Might lead to an elevated cost at the end if a task is not on schedule.

Cons:
- A process that might work with small projects.
- Might work if there is a good feedback and help from the community.
- Can work if the developing team is small and open for constant discussion.
